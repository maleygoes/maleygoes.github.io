  <introduction>
    <p>
      One of the biggest uses of algebra
      (and mathematics in general)
      is describing and modeling the relationship between two related quantities.
      For example, we might want to:
      <ol marker="labelcirc">
        <li>
          <p>
            find the amount of grass seed we need to cover an athletic field based on its size, or
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            calculate the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit for a temperature in Celsius, or
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            price a vacation package based on the number of nights we want to stay, or
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            estimate when we will arrive at our destination from how many miles we have left to travel, or
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            determine the grade needed on a final exam to achieve a desired final course grade
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      and we could easily come up with many, many more examples.
      In this chapter,
      we'll develop techniques that will be useful in handling these sorts of situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though these examples deal with unrelated things,
      they all have something in common.
      Each involves a relationship between two quantities,
      and in each we have in mind that we will know the value
      (or values)
      we want to consider for one of the quantities
      (the Celsius temperature, the field size, the number of nights,
      the distance left to travel, or the desired grade),
      and we will want to find the value(s) of the other quantity as a result.
      You might have several athletic fields to seed,
      and need to figure out how much grass seed you need to take to each one to complete the job.
      Or you might be taking a trip to Canada,
      where temperatures are given in Celsius,
      and want to have a way to convert them to more familiar Fahrenheit temperatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      These situations all fit nicely into a general framework called a function.
      In this chapter, we will introduce functions,
      and show how they can be used in these and other situations.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Functions</title>
    <p>
      We'll start by defining functions and related terms.
      This all may seem overwhelming at first,
      but don't worry – it should make more sense after looking at a few examples.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
              <idx><h>Function</h></idx> <em><em>Function Definition</em></em>
        </p>
        <p>
          A function is a rule which processes information by assigning one and only one output to each input.
          If the input variable's name is <m>x</m>,
          the output variable is <m>y</m>,
          and the name of the function is <m>f</m>,
          we write <m>y=f(x)</m> which is read as
          <q><m>y</m> equals <m>f</m> of <m>x</m>.</q>
          (Other letters can be used for any of the quantities involved,
          but whatever letters are used they follow the same pattern.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Functions can be represented using a function diagram like this:
          <me>
            input \rightarrow f \rightarrow output
          </me>
          or using variables:
          <me>
            x \rightarrow f \rightarrow y \text{  OR  }  x \rightarrow f \rightarrow f(x)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          When a function exists between two quantities, we say that
          <q>the output variable
          (or quantity)
          is a function of the input variable (or quantity).</q>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Perfectly clear?
      Probably not – that's a lot of terminology to absorb all at once.
      With practice, though, these terms will become familiar.
      Let's take a look at a couple of examples to illustrate how it all works.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FunctionsExample1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The amount of grass seed
          (in pounds)
          needed to cover an athletic field can be determined based on the area
          (in square feet).
          Let <m>y</m> represent the amount of grass seed and let <m>A</m> represent the area.
          <ol marker="a">
            <li>
              <p>
                State the input variable and quantity.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                State the output variable and quantity.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Describe the relationship by stating
                <q>is a function of</q>
                using both the variables and the quantities they represent.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Assuming the function's name is <m>f</m>,
                write an equation which relates the variables and the function.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <ol marker="a">
      <li>
        <p>
          The relationship described here says that we are going to determine the amount of seed based on the area.
          The question does not say we need to draw a function diagram,
          but it may be helpful to do this.
          It seems that we are meant to
          <q>tell</q>
          the function the area we need to cover, and then
          <q>ask</q>
          the function to then determine how much grass seed we need.
          So the function diagram would look like this:
          <me>
            area \rightarrow f \rightarrow grass \text{ }  seed
          </me>
          and from this diagram it is clear that the input quantity is area
          (in square feet)
          and the input variable is <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          From the diagram we can see that the output quantity is pounds of grass seed,
          and the output variable is <m>y</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The phrasing always follows the patters
          <q>output is a function of input</q>. So, using quantities, we would say that
          <q>the amount of grass seed, <m>y</m>,
          is a function of the area, <m>A</m></q>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Following the pattern used in the definition,
          we would write <m>y=f(A)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      A function can be imagined as a kind of computer,
      programmed to process just the information we want.
      The function diagrams can help with that.
      In the example we just saw,
      the description clearly indicated that we'd need something we could tell the area of the field and then have it figure out and tell us how much grass seed we'd need.
      Drawing a diagram to reflect this flow of information makes it clear which is the input and which is the output,
      and then following the definitions everything else just falls into place.
      With practice,
      you may not need to draw diagrams or look back at definitions.
      But until you've reached the point where this is all second nature,
      it's a good idea to follow the method shown in the example.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FunctionsExample2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The Fahrenheit temperature <m>F</m> can be calculated for any temperature in Celsius,
          <m>C</m>.
          Let the function which calculates this be called <m>T</m>.

          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The problem states that we want to determine Fahrenheit for a given Celsius temperature.
      So we want our function to do this:
      <me>
        C \rightarrow T \rightarrow F
      </me>
      <ol marker="a">
        <li>
          <p>
            The input quantity is degrees Celsius,
            and the input variable is <m>C</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The output quantity is degrees Fahrenheit and the output variable is <m>F</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            It's always
            <q><em>output</em> is a function of <em>input</em></q>, so we would say
            <q>the Fahrenheit temperature, <m>F</m>,
            is a function of the Celsius temperature, <m>C</m></q>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example Celsius is the input and Fahrenheit is the output.
      Could it be the other way around?
      Well, with Fahrenheit and Celsius temperatures at least,
      sure it could.
      We could figure out Celsius based on Fahrenheit just as well as Fahrenheit based on Celsius.
      Which is input and which is output is determined by what we are trying to do.
      The description of this problem made it clear that in this case we want to determine Fahrenheit for a given Celsius temperature,
      and that's why we set our function up that way.
      You have to read carefully to determine input and output – be careful!
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Functions and Formulas</title>
    <p>
      Now, in what we've done so far,
      we've been able to determine the setup of the input-output function relationship and describe it in appropriate terminology,
      but we haven't had enough information to actually find the correct output for any particular input value.
      To do that, we need to know the details of the function's rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common way to give a function's rule is with a formula.
      A simple example will illustrate.
      Suppose we want to set up a function to find the area <m>A</m> of a square based on the length of its side,
      <m>s</m>.
      This function would take side length as its input,
      and give area as its output.
      So we would say that area is a function of side length,
      or <m>A</m> is a function of <m>s</m>.
      If we name the function <m>f</m>,
      we could write <m>A = f(s)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we can go further.
      We know how to calculate the area of a square based on its side length.
      Using our variables,
      we can write the formula for the area of a square as
      <me>
        A = s^2
      </me>
      or, replacing the output variable with <m>f(s)</m> we could write this formula as
      <me>
        f(s) = s^2
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We've taken the formula for the area of a square and used it to write a formula for the function which finds the area of a square.
      For any given input value of <m>s</m>,
      this formula tells you that the output value you want can be found by using that value in the formula <m>s^2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, once we have this formula for the function,
      we can find the output for any input by algebraic substitution into a formula.
      For example,
      suppose we want to find the area of a square whose length is <m>10</m> inches.
      We would then use <m>s = 10</m> in our formula to get:
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp  f(s)=s^2 \amp  f(10)=10^2 \amp  f(10)=100</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Not surprisingly the formula tells us the area would be <m>100</m> square inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we move on,
      notice that we substituted for <m>s</m> both in the formula itself and also inside the
      <q><m>f()</m>.</q>
      This left us with the expression
      <q><m>f(10)</m></q>
      on the left side.
      This will happen whenever we replace the input variable with a specific value.
      So wherever we might run into the expression
      <q><m>f(10)</m></q>
      we would understand that to mean
      <q>the specific output you get from the function <m>f</m> with the input <m>10</m></q>. A shorter way of saying that is
      <q><m>f</m> of <m>10</m></q>. Likewise, we would read
      <q><m>f(5.3)</m></q>
      as
      <q><m>f</m> of <m>5.3</m></q>
      and would understand that to mean the output you get from the function <m>f</m> if you input the value <m>5.3</m>.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FunctionsExample3">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The Fahrenheit temperature <m>F</m> is a function of the Celsius temperature <m>C</m>.
          The formula for this function is given by <m>T(C)=\frac{9}{5}C+32</m>.
          Use this function formula to find the Fahrenheit temperature equivalent to <m>30 ^\circ C</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      We need to use <m>C=30</m> in the formula.
      We get:
      <md>
        <mrow>T(C)\amp =\frac{9}{5}C+32</mrow>
        <mrow>T(30)\amp =\frac{9}{5}(30)+32</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =86</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Fahrenheit temperature corresponding to
      <m>30 ^\circ C</m> would be <m>86 ^\circ F</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it is nice to know the purpose of a function,
      but if all we have is a formula we can still calculate outputs for inputs just the same.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FunctionsExample4">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>f(x)=x^2-3x+1</m>.
          Find <m>f(-2)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      <m>f(-2)</m> is the result of using <m>-2</m> as an input into this function.
      So:
      <md>
        <mrow>f(x)\amp =x^2-3x+1</mrow>
        <mrow>f(-2)\amp =(-2)^2-3(-2)+1</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =4+6+1</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =11</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Functions Defined Verbally</title>
    <p>
      Formulas are a very handy way to state a function's rule.
      But having a formula is not required.
      To have a function,
      you must have one and only one output for each input.
      The way you get that input may be specified by a formula,
      but it can be expressed in other ways.
      One of these other ways is a verbal description of the rule.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FunctionsExample5">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The sales tax rate in Ontario County, NY is <m>7.5 \%</m>.
          Let <m>f(t)</m> be the total price including tax for a purchase of <m>t</m> dollars.
          Find <m>f(800)</m>,
          the price including sales tax for a laptop priced at <m>$ 800</m>.
          Express your answer both as an answer to the question and in function notation.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The sales tax is <m>7.5 \%</m> of
      <m>$800</m> which would be <m>(0.075)($800) = $60</m>.
      So the total price would be <m>$800 + $60 = $860</m>.
      So, in answer to the question,
      the price including tax is <m>$860</m>.
      In function notation we would write <m>f(800)=860</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, we didn't have a formula,
      but we had enough information to calculate the output,
      nonetheless.
      If we wanted to, we could come up with a formula for this function.
      It is not too hard to see that this function could also be given as <m>f(t)=.075t+t</m>.
      Sometimes, though,
      we may have a function for which a formula would be utterly impossible.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FunctionsExample6">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>f</m> is the rule which assigns to each U.S. state its capital.
          Find <m>f(Washington)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The function takes states as inputs and gives their capitals as outputs.
      There is obviously no way we could ever write an algebraic formula to
      <q>calculate</q>
      this.
      But, we can still determine the output for a given input.
      If you don't happen to know the state capital of Washington,
      a few moments with an atlas or surfing the web reveals that <m>f(Washington)=Olympia</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state capital example reveals something else about functions:
      they don't necessarily have to involve numbers or quantities.
      Other pieces of information, such as states or their capitals,
      can be used as the inputs and outputs for a function.
      In mathematics,
      we are usually most interested in functions with numerical inputs and outputs – and most of the functions we'll see in this class will be numeric ones.
      But non-numeric functions like this are nonetheless perfectly good functions.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Functions Defined by Tables</title>
    <p>
      Sometimes neither a formula nor a verbal description is available to give a function's rule.
      Functions can also be defined using a table which lists inputs and gives their corresponding outputs.
      We don't need to know what the rationale
      (if any)
      was for assigning any particular input its output <mdash /> we only need to be able to determine what the output is.
    </p>
    <p>
      One common example of a table-defined function might be US Social Security numbers.
      Each US citizen has one and only one Social Security number,
      and so we can look at Social Security numbers as a function of US citizens.
      There is no way to possibly define any algebraic formula for this function,
      nor is there any way to verbally describe a rule that would let you figure out someone's Social Security number based on who they are
      (if you ever did find such a rule,
      you could make a fortune in identity theft.)
      The only way to specify that function would be by listing out every citizen and his or her number.
      This would be impractical to do on paper,
      but it is not hard to imagine that a computer could contain this information in a massive table.
      In fact, the Social Security Administration has such a table in their computer systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a more modest example of a table-defined function.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FunctionsExample7">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(s)</m> be the fine in Pennsylvania for speeding in a <m>65 mph</m> zone.
          A highway road sign shows the fine for speeding as a function of how fast you were going.
        </p>
        <tabular>
          <row>
            <cell>Speed</cell>
            <cell>Fine</cell>
          </row>

        </tabular>
        <p>
          Find <m>f(80)</m>, the fine for going <m>80</m> mph.
          Express your result as an answer to the question and also in function notation.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Reading the table we can see that the fine is <m>$65</m>.
      In function notation we would write <m>f(80)=65</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A word of warning about table-defined functions.
      Unless you have extra information about how the function's outputs are determined,
      you cannot use a table to find outputs for any inputs that are not listed in the table.
      Table-defined functions are limited to only the inputs listed in the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,
      suppose you want to know the fine for going <m>90</m> mph.
      There is no way to tell this from the given table.
      It seems that for every <m>5</m> mph increase in speed the fine goes up <m>$10</m>,
      so it might be reasonable to guess the fine would be <m>$85</m>.
      But that is only a guess.
      It could also be that the maximum fine for speeding is <m>$75</m>,
      so that might be the fine for a <m>90</m> mph speed.
      Or, maybe the state has an extra fine tacked on for really excessive speeds,
      making the fine for <m>90</m> mph <m>$100</m>,
      or <m>$150</m>, or <m>$250</m>?
      There just is no way of knowing for sure.
      Based on this table,
      you cannot determine the fine for a <m>90 mph</m> speed.
      But really you shouldn't be driving that fast anyway.

    <title>Domain and Range</title>
    <p>
      We've defined a function to be any rule that takes inputs,
      processes them according to some rule,
      and then gives outputs as a result.
      We haven't said much, though,
      about what sorts of things we can use as inputs or get as outputs from our functions.
      For a given function, some things would make sense as inputs,
      and some things would not.
      In <xref ref="FunctionsExample6">Example</xref>
      (the state capitals function)
      it would make sense to use
      <q>Washington</q>,
      <q>Nebraska</q>, or
      <q>Rhode Island</q>
      as inputs, since these are all states.
      But it wouldn't make any sense at all to input the
      <q>Pacific Ocean</q>, the number <m>8</m>, or
      <q>Justin Bieber</q>
      into that function – none of these are states,
      and so asking what the state capital of the Pacific Ocean, 8, or the Bieb wouldn't make any sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, for the function
      <m>f(x)=x^2-3x+1</m> which we used in <xref ref="FunctionsExample4">Example</xref>
      it makes perfect sense to input the number 8, but
      <q>Washington</q>,
      <q>Nebraska</q>
      or
      <q>Rhode Island</q>
      don't make any more sense as inputs than an ocean or a teen idol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every function has a certain set of things that it can take as inputs,
      and also a set of things that can show up as outputs.
      These are called the domain and range respectively.
      They're important enough to deserve a highlighted definition:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
              <idx><h>Function</h><h>Domain</h></idx>
              <idx><h>Function</h><h>Range</h></idx>
          <em><em>Domain and Range</em></em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The set of all possible inputs for a function is called its <em>domain</em>.
          The set of all possible outputs for a function is called its <em>range</em>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      For a function like the state capitals function,
      determining the domain and range is a matter of asking yourself what sorts of things the described function is intended to take as inputs,
      and what the relevant outputs would be.
      For the state capitals example,
      the domain is the set of all U.S. states.
      More formally we could write this as <m>\{ x \vert x \text{ is a U.S. State }  \}</m>.
      The range would be the set of all U.S. state capitals;
      formally <m>\{ y \vert y \text{ is a U.S. state capital } \}</m>.
      Note that the letters used in the formal set descriptions don't matter <mdash /> the domain could also have been written
      <m>\{ t \vert t \text{ is a U.S. State }  \}</m> or using any other letter.
      (You should ask your instructor whether or not you are expected to write domains and ranges in formal set-builder notation or can just give a verbal description.)
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FunctionsExample8">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>c(t)</m> be the rule that tells what day of the week each human being <m>t</m> was born on.
          What are the domain and range of this function?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      This function takes as inputs human beings.
      So the domain would be the set of all human beings,
      or <m>\{t \vert t \text{ is a human being } \}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outputs from this function are days of the week.
      So the domain would be the set of days of the week,
      or <m>\{y \vert y \text{ is a day of the week } \}</m>,
      or <m>\{</m>Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday<m>\}</m>. }
    </p>
    <p>
      For a numerical function like
      <m>f(x)=x^2-3x+1</m> the domain would be the set of all real numbers,
      or <m>\mathbb{R}</m>,
      since any real number could be substituted into the formula and give a result.
      The range for this function is a more complicated question.
      While the outputs from this function will obviously be real numbers,
      it's not obvious whether every real number actually does end up as an output from this function.
      In fact, it turns out that there are lots of real numbers that cannot possibly be output from this function.
      For example,
      no matter what you input for <m>x</m> you will never get <m>-5</m> out of this function
      (take our word for that for now,
      though you'll see how we know this can never happen later in the course.)
      So, the range is not the set of all real numbers.
      At this point in the course we are not ready to determine just what the range of this function is,
      so we will avoid questions about the ranges of functions like this one for now (we'll revisit this question later.)
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FunctionsExample9">
      <statement>
        <p>
          What is the domain of the function <m>g(z)=2z+\frac{z^2}{5}</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Any real number could be substituted in to this formula and give a result.
      So the domain is <m>\mathbb{R}</m>,
      the set of all real numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes there are real numbers that cannot be substituted in to a formula to give an output.
      For example,
      the function <m>h(x)=\frac{1}{x}</m> cannot have the number <m>0</m> in its domain,
      because if you substitute zero into the formula you get <m>\frac{1}{0}</m> which is undefined.
      Any other real number, though, would be fine.
      So the domain of this function is all nonzero real numbers,
      or <m>\{x \vert x\ne 0\}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point in your mathematical career,
      you know about two impossibilities.
      You cannot divide by zero,
      and you cannot take the square root of a negative number.
      So, if a function's rule asks you to divide by or take the square root of anything involving the input variable,
      we need to make sure to exclude from its domain any values that would require doing the impossible.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FunctionsExample10">
      <statement>
        <p>
          What is the domain of the function <m>f(x)=\frac{3x^2 -5x+73}{x-3}</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The numerator looks intimidating,
      but it doesn't matter to us.
      Nothing impossible will happen in the numerator,
      no matter what value of <m>x</m> you input.
      On the other hand,
      we must make sure that the denominator is never zero.
      So, to find the value we need to exclude from the domain,
      we solve the equation <m>x-3=0</m> and get <m>x=3</m>.
      So since <m>x=3</m> would give us a zero denominator,
      we must exclude it from the domain.
      So the domain is all real numbers except 3, or <m>\{x \vert x \ne 3\}</m>.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FunctionsExample11">
      <statement>
        <p>
          What is the domain of the function <m>g(x)=\sqrt{3x-2}</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Here we need to make sure that the expression in the square root is not negative, or,
      in other words, that it is greater than or equal to zero.
      So we solve <m>3x-2 \ge 0</m> and get that <m>x \ge \frac{2}{3}</m>.
      So our domain is all real numbers greater than or equal to <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>,
      or <m>\{ x \vert x \ge \frac{2}{3} \}</m>, or <m>[2,\infty)</m>.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Determining Whether or Not a Rule is a Function</title>
    <p>
      Not every rule is a function.
      When we have a function,
      we demand that it provide us a clear and unambiguous output for any input we give it.
      If I input the length of a square's side, I want to know the area.
      I don't want a list of several different possible areas.
      If I know the Celsius temperature is
      <m>10^\circ C</m> and want to convert that to Fahrenheit, I want one and only one answer to that question.
      I don't want to be told,
      <q>well, it might be <m>50^\circ F</m>,
      or it might be <m>84^\circ F</m>,
      or it might be twenty below.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our definition of a function requires that for each input we get one and only one output.
      A function isn't allowed to hedge.
      Functions have to always give a straight answer!
      So, a rule that does not do this can't be a function.
    </p>
    <p>
      How could a rule not meet this requirement?
      Well, just about any algebraic formula can be used to define a function.
      We know from experience that the basic mathematical operations always evaluate to the same result.
      (Six times nine is fifty-four,
      it was fifty-four yesterday,
      it will be fifty-four tomorrow,
      it is fifty-four in New York,
      it is fifty-four in China, it is always always always always fifty-four.)
      So we know that <m>f(x)=5x^3-7x^2-3x-9</m> is a perfectly good function,
      because no matter what input we substitute in for <m>x</m>,
      the process of evaluating the result will always give one and only one final answer,
      and whatever that answer is it will be the same anytime,
      anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not all rules behave this way.
      Sometimes, though,
      we try to set up a function and end up with a rule that can give more than one output for a given input.
      The following examples will illustrate a few cases where this may be a problem.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FunctionsExample12">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>h(c)</m> be the rule that tells you the current NHL hockey team for each location that is the named home of a current NHL team.
          Does this rule define a function?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      This rule is set up to process information,
      taking homes of NHL teams as inputs and giving the teams themselves as outputs:
      <me>
        \text{ home }  \rightarrow h \rightarrow \text{ team }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for many locations this works fine.
      For example:
      <me>
        \text{ Buffalo }  \rightarrow h \rightarrow \text{ Sabres }
      </me>
      and similarly if we input Boston, Toronto,
      or Montreal things work out fine;
      we get the Bruins, the Leafs,
      and the Canadiens as outputs respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we run into a problem if we input New York.
      There are two NHL teams that call New York home:
      the Islanders and the Rangers.
      Which is the output?
      According to our rule, they both are.
      This is not allowed.
      This
      <q>function</q>
      doesn't give us a single straight answer,
      and so it is not a function after all!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now a couple of comments are important here.
      It does not matter that most of the time this rule would have given only one output.
      If there is even one single input that gives multiple outputs,
      the rule is not a function.
      That doesn't mean that it is meaningless,
      or that it doesn't describe any real relationship.
      But it does mean it is not a function.
      Rules like our NHL example that can give multiple outputs for an input are called multifunctions and are used in some situations
      (though we won't be using them in this book.)
      But they are absolutely not functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, sometimes people will mistakenly think a rule is not a function because some inputs don't give any output.
      If you input San Diego into this rule,
      for example, you don't get an output,
      because San Diego does not have a current NHL team.
      This is not a problem.
      That only means that San Diego is not in the domain!
      A rule does not have to give an output for every imaginable input to be a function.
      The rule only has to give one and only one output for each input in its domain.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FunctionsExample13">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>k(t)</m> be the rule that assigns to each current NHL team the team's named home.
          Is <m>k(t)</m> a function?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      This rule is set up to take teams as inputs and give homes as outputs:
      <me>
        \text{ team }  \rightarrow k \rightarrow \text{ home }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, here we do not have the problem from the previous example.
      If you input the Sabres you get Buffalo,
      input the Bruins you get Boston, etc.
      But if you input the Rangers you get one and only one output: New York.
      And if you input the Islanders you also get one and only one output: New York.
      The fact that two distinct inputs give the same output is not a problem!
      Since no two teams have two named homes, this is a function.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to contrast these last two examples.
      Remember: a function must give one and only one output for each input.
      If there is even one input that gives two outputs according to a rule,
      that rule is not a function.
      So, this is not OK:
      <me>
        \text{ New York }  \rightarrow h \begin{array}{l} \rightarrow \text{ Rangers? } \\ \rightarrow \text{ Islanders? } \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is absolutely nothing wrong with two inputs sharing the same output.
      This is OK:
      <me>
        \begin{array}{l} \text{ Rangers }  \rightarrow \\ \text{ Islanders }  \rightarrow \end{array}  k \begin{array}{l} \rightarrow \text{ New York } \\ \rightarrow  \text{ New York } \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The key to functions is that they must never give an ambiguous answer.
      In the first case, is the output the Rangers or the Islanders?
      Can't tell?
      Well, that's a problem.
      In the second case,
      there's no ambiguity about what the output is for any input.
      So that's not a problem at all.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FunctionsExample14">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Is the following rule a function?
          Why or why not?
          <m>p(x)=42</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      This rule is a bit ridiculous.
      No matter what you input for <m>x</m>,
      you always get the same output: <m>42</m>.
      However, that makes this a perfectly fine function.
      There is nothing you could possibly input for <m>x</m> that would give you two or more different outputs.
      There is always one and only one output for any given input.
      So this rule is a function.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that when you are showing that a rule is not a function,
      all you need to do is give any one input that has two outputs.
      There is no need to discuss whether or not the example you give is the only one,
      one of many, or one of infinitely many.
      Don't get bogged down in extra unnecessary details.
      To show that a rule is not a function,
      you only need one input that gives more than one output.
      Anything more is unnecessary.
