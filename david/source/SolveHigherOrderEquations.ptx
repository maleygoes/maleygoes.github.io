  <title>Solving Equations of Degree 2 or Greater</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The following exercises will contain concepts covered in chapters 1
      (use of the balance principal),
      chapter 2
      (some exponent properties)
      and the previous section, solving second degree equations.
      As you may have picked up on,
      solving an equation of any degree still makes use of the balance principal,
      manipulating the equation to isolate the variable.
      As you saw in the previous section,
      when we had a second degree equation,
      one option is to use the square root property.
      Recall this example:
      <me>
        x^2 = 25
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We wanted to isolate that <m>x</m>,
      and in order to do so we needed to
      <q>undo</q>
      that power of <m>2</m>.
      Our method was to take the square root of the left side and subsequently the right side as well to do so:
      <me>
        \sqrt{x^2} = \sqrt{25}
      </me>
      leading to: <m>x = \pm 5</m>.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Rational Exponents</title>
    <p>
      We are now going to consider what happens in such a situation where the exponent on the variable is larger than <m>2</m>.
      Everything above is based on the fact that the square root of a number, (<m>\sqrt(k)</m>),
      gives us a solution to <m>x^2=k</m>.
      We need to explore this in more detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>\sqrt{16} = 4</m>,
      the phrase square root literally comes from the area of a square.
      A square with side lengths of <m>4</m>cm has an area of <m>16 \text{ cm } ^2</m>.
      If we are being completely formal,
      we'd write the expression <m>\sqrt{16}</m> like this:
      <me>
        \sqrt{16}=\sqrt[2]{16^1}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <q>2</q>
      on the outside of the radical is called the <em>index</em>.
      As a matter of efficiency,
      humans stopped writing this index of <m>2</m> with square roots because we use them so frequently.
      The
      <q><m>1</m></q>
      on the inside, with the base of <m>16</m>,
      is still called the <em>exponent</em> or <em>power</em>.
      We can further rewrite the expression like this:
      <me>
        \sqrt{16}=\sqrt[2]{16^1}=16^{\frac{1}{2}}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Unique.
      Check your calculator to see the expressions are actually equivalent.
      <m>16^{\frac{1}{2}}</m> can be entered into your calculator as
      <q><m>16^\wedge(1/2)</m></q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, what does the expression <m>\sqrt[3]{27}</m> represent?
      We read this as the
      <q>cube root of <m>27</m></q>
      or as the
      <q>third root of <m>27</m></q>. It can be rewritten as:
      <me>
        \sqrt[3]{27} = \sqrt[3]{27^1} = 27^{\frac{1}{3}}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Evaluating this last expression using your calculator yields <m>3</m>.
      Why?
      Because <m>3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 27</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, the <m>n^{\text{ th } }</m> root of a number,
      expressed as <m>\sqrt[n]{}</m> represent a number that when multiplied by itself <m>n</m> times gives back what was rooted.
      That will make more sense with some more examples.

        <p>
          Find <m>\sqrt[4]{81}</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Using the ration exponent rule,
      we have that <m>\sqrt[4]{81}=81^{\frac{1}{4}}</m>.
      Using a calculator one finds that
      <m>81^{\frac{1}{4}}=81^\wedge (1/4)=3</m> and it is readily verified that <m>3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 =81</m>.

    <example xml:id="SolveHigherOrderEquationsExample2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Rewrite the expression <m>\sqrt[3]{2x}</m> using fractional exponents
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Both the <m>2</m> and the <m>x</m> are being â€˜cube rooted' so
      <me>
        \sqrt[3]{2x}=(2x)^{\frac{1}{3}}
      </me>

    </example>
    <p>
      Everything inside the parenthesis is being raised to the <m>\frac{1}{6}</m> power, so;
      <me>
        (5c^2d)^{\frac{1}{6}}=\sqrt[6]{5c^2d}
