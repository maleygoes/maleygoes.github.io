      A 4000 year old Babylonian tablet,
      now on display at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University,
      poses the following question:
    </p>
    <p>
      <q>If the cost of digging a trench is 9 gin,
      and the trench has a length of 5 ninda and is one-half ninda deep,
      and if a worker's daily load of earth costs 10 gin to move,
      and his daily wages are 6 se of silver,
      then how wide is the canal?</q><fn>
      Source: Exhibition Review: \quotes{Masters of Math,
      from Old Babylon} by Edward Rothstein.
      New York Times. 11/26/10
      </fn>
    </p>
    <p>
      Except for the unfamiliar units
      (what the heck is a ninda or a gin or a se?)
      this looks like a pretty typical algebra problem,
      and you might imagine ancient Babylonian students sweating over this problem in algebra class.
      You might imagine them struggling through the wording to set up an equation,
      and then wrestling through the algebra to solve that equation and get the answer.
      Except for one thing:
      algebra as we know it wasn't invented until thousands of years later.<fn>
      There was no moment of invention,
      and no single inventor of algebra,
      so we can't really pinpoint \quotes{when algebra was invented}. The methods we now call \quotes{algebra} developed over the course of more than 1000 years.
      But all of that happened long after the Babylonians.
      Most people consider the start of development of our familiar variables-and-equations algebra to the work of the Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, who lived from around 780-850 CE. The word \quotes{algebra} comes from one of the words in the Arabic title of one of his books \quotes{Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣ ar fī ḥ isāb al-jabr wa-l-muqābala}.
      </fn>
    </p>
    <p>
      The methods available to Babylonian math students and their teachers didn't include the tools of variables and equations that we are so used to today.
      They had their methods of course,
      but a problem like this was vastly more difficult to solve without the tools than we now take for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though it may not always seem that way,
      the point of algebra is to make problem solving simpler.
      We use variables, algebraic expressions built from them,
      and equations using them to approach problem-solving in a logical and organized way.
      In this chapter,
      we'll review some of the basic tools and methods of this approach.
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Substitution in Algebraic Expressions</title>
    <p>
      In algebra we use symbols as a more compact alternative to ordinary language.
      For example, the fact:
    </p>
    <p>
      The area of a rectangle is the result of multiplying its length by its width
    </p>
    <p>
      can be expressed much more simply using mathematical symbols and variables in place of words and as the equation:
      <me>
        A=LW
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the English sentence and the equation are saying the same thing,
      but it is usually advantageous to use symbols rather than words.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <em>algebraic expression</em>
          <idx><h>Algebraic Expression</h></idx>
      is any collection of variables and/or numbers tied together by arithmetic operations.
      In the above equation, we used the algebraic expression
      <q>LW</q>
      to represent the instructions for calculating the area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, suppose we have a rectangular garden that measures 20 feet by 16 feet.
      To calculate its area, we can use the equation above,
      plugging in 20 for <m>L</m> and 16 for <m>W</m>, to get:
      <me>
        A = (20 \text{ feet } )(16 \text{ feet } ) = 320 \text{ square feet }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      <q>Plugging in</q>
      specific values for the variables and evaluating the result is more formally known as
          <idx><h>Algebraic Substitution</h></idx>
      <em>algebraic substitution</em>.
    </p>
    <algorithm xml:id="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Evaluate the algebraic expression
          <m>t^2+2t-4p</m> if <m>t=7</m> and <m>p=-3</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </algorithm>
    <p>
      We start with the equation,
      and then replace the variables <m>t</m> and <m>p</m> with their given values,
      and then do the arithmetic:
      <me>
        t^2+2t-4p=(7)^2+2(7)-4(-3)=75
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we don't know what this algebraic expression is meant to represent or the appropriate units for the variables represent,
      we just leave the final answer as <m>75</m>. }
    </p>
    <algorithm xml:id="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Evaluate <m>\frac{c^2V}{2}</m> if <m>c=-3</m> and <m>V=200</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </algorithm>
    <p>
      The original equation contains <m>c^2</m>,
      so whatever <m>c</m> is, we need to square it.
      But if we write <m>-3^2</m>,
      remember that it is only the <m>3</m> that gets squared.
      To make sure that the entire <m>-3</m> will be squared,
      we need to use parentheses:
      <me>
        \frac{c^2 V}{2} = \frac{(-3)^2(200)}{2} = \frac{9*200}{2} = \frac{1800}{2} = 900
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The example above warns of a common and easy-to-make mistake when substituting negative numbers.
      This error can always be avoided by putting parentheses around the number.
      While parentheses are not always needed,
      you may want to consider always putting parentheses around negative numbers when you substitute them in,
      to play it safe.
    </p>
    <algorithm xml:id="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample3">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Evaluate <m>P^2T^3-1</m> if <m>P=-4</m> and <m>T=2</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </algorithm>
    <p>
      Substituting in the given values:
      <me>
        P^2T^3-1=(-4)^2(2)^3-1=16*8-1=128-1=127
      </me>

  <subsection>
    <title>Formulas</title>
    <p>
      When we use an algebraic expression or an equation involving algebraic expressions to express a specific relationship between quantities,
      we usually call it a formula.
      In the discussion above,
      the equation <m>A=LW</m> is the formula for the area of a rectangle.
      On the other hand,
      we would probably not call the algebraic expressions in <xref ref="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample1">Examples</xref>,
      <xref ref="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample2" />
      and <xref ref="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample3" /> formulas,
      because we don't really have any sense of those expressions' purposes or meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are just substituting into algebraic expressions without any sense of what they represent,
      all you can give in a final answer is the just numeric result.
      When you have know the units involved or the meaning of what you are calculating,
      it is appropriate to state your final answer using the appropriate units and/or in a way that relates it to the meaning.
    </p>
    <algorithm xml:id="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample4">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The formula for converting from temperature in Fahrenheit to temperature in Celsius is <m>C=\frac{5}{9}(F-32)</m>.
          If the temperature is <m>14 ^\circ \text{F}</m>,
          what is the temperature in Celsius?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </algorithm>
    <p>
      It is clear that in the formula <m>F</m> represents temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and <m>C</m> represents temperature in degrees Celsius.
      So we substitute given <m>F=14</m> to get:
      <md>
        <mrow>C \amp  =\frac{5}{9}(F-32)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \frac{5}{9}(14-32)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  =\frac{5}{9}(-18)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = -10</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we know the units involved here,
      it would be most appropriate to state the final answer as
      <q>the temperature is <m>-10^\circ \text{C}</m></q>
      or simply
      <q><m>-10^\circ \text{C}</m>.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      <q><m>C=-10</m></q>
      would probably not be a satisfactory answer in this situation.
      If you asked someone
      <q>What is <m>14^\circ</m> Fahrenheit in Celsius</q>
      and they answered
      <q><m>C=-10</m></q>
      you'd probably find that a pretty strange way of talking. }
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, if you don't know the appropriate units or the context,
      then you can only reasonably give the numeric answer.
    </p>
    <algorithm xml:id="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample5">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The formula for the energy stored in a charged capacitor is <m>W=\frac{1}{2}cv^2</m>.
          Calculate <m>W</m> if <m>c=100</m> and <m>v=50</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </algorithm>
    <md>
      <mrow>W \amp  = \frac{1}{2}(100)(50)^2</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = \frac{1}{2}(100)(2500)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = \frac{1}{2}(250,000)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = 125,000</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>
      In this case, the best we can do is say
      <q>the energy stored is <m>W=125,000</m></q>
      or even just
      <q><m>W=125,000</m></q>, since we don't know the units.
      If we don't know the units or the meaning for a formula,
      obviously we can't be expected to use them in the final answer.
      If, however, we did know the units,
      it would be appropriate to use them. }
    </p>
    <algorithm xml:id="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample6">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The energy, in joules,
          stored in a charged capacitor is given by <m>W=\frac{1}{2}cv^2</m>,
          where <m>c</m> is the capacitance in farads and <m>v</m> is the current in volts.
          Determine the energy stored if the capacitance is 100 farads and the current is 50 volts.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </algorithm>
    <p>
      This is the same problem as <xref ref="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample5">Example</xref>,
      except that here we know more about what the formula represents.
      A more appropriate answer to this question would be
      <q>the energy stored is 125,000 joules</q>
      or just
      <q>125,000 joules</q>.

    <title>Input-Output and Your Calculator</title>
    <p>
      Sometimes we have a formula that we need to use repeatedly.
      Suppose that you are doing a presentation for a phys ed class where you want to show the relationship between daily exercise and weight.
      In your research,
      you've formulas that predict a person's weight one year from now based on how much they exercise.
      For a 40 year old man who is 5' 10'' and weighs 200 lbs,
      and who consumes 2800 calories per day,
      his projected weight <m>W</m> one year from now is given by the formula:
      <me>
        W=210-\frac{m}{3}
      </me>
      where <m>m</m> is the number of minutes of vigorous exercise he gets on average per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don't think just showing this formula will give your audience a very good sense of the relationship between exercise and weight,
      and so you want to present a table,
      showing what his projected weight would be at different levels of exercise,
      something like this:
    </p>
    <tabular>
      <row bottom="minor">
        <cell />
        <cell />
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>If his average daily vigorous exercise is:</cell>
        <cell>His projected weight in one year would be:</cell>
      </row>
      <row bottom="minor">

      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>none</cell>
        <cell />
      </row>
      <row bottom="minor">

        <cell />
      </row>
      <row>

        <cell />
      </row>
      <row bottom="minor">

        <cell />
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>60</cell>
        <cell />
      </row>
      <row bottom="minor">

        <cell />
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>90</cell>
        <cell />
      </row>
      <row bottom="minor">

      </row>

        <cell />
      </row>
    </tabular>
    <p>
      To fill in the projected weights in this table,
      you will need to substitute each of the different exercise amounts into the formula.
      This sort of table is called an input-output table,
      because it shows the result (output) you get with each different value you input into the formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not difficult to do this by hand,
      but it is a little tedious.
      Your TI-83 or TI-84 calculator has the built-in ability to create tables for a given formula.
      Let's walk through how to use the calculator to create this table.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, we need to give the calculator the formula we are using.
      In the upper left hand corner of your calculator,
      you should see a key labeled
      <q>Y=</q>. Hit this key now and you should see a screen that looks like this:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <caption>Calculator Formula Input Screen</caption>
      <image source="AlgebraicSubstitutionImages\CalculatorFormulaScreen.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      If there are any formulas already entered,
      you can either type over them or delete them using the
      <q>CLEAR</q>
      key.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calculator can keep track of multiple formulas at once,
      but we only need to use the one right now,
      so we will just enter our formula on the Y1 line.
    </p>
    <p>
      While any letter at all can be used as a variable,
      the calculator is not quite so flexible.
      The input variable
      (the one you are going to substitute different values for)
      must always be X, and the output variable
      (the result)
      must always be Y. Since the
      <q>Y1=</q>
      is already built in, we just need to enter the
      <q>210-X/3</q>
      part of the formula.
      You can do that now using the calculator keypad.
      For the X, you'll notice a key labeled
      <q><m>\text{X} ,\text{T} ,\theta,\text{n}</m></q>. Hitting that key will give you the X you need.
      The result should look like this:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <caption>Formula Entered into Calculator</caption>
      <image source="AlgebraicSubstitutionImages\CalculatorFormulaEx6Small.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      Now, to set up the table.
      In the top row of your calculator you will see a key labeled
      <q>WINDOW</q>
      with
      <q>TBLSET</q>
      marked above it.
      Hit
      <q>2nd</q>
      and then that key, and you will arrive at the Table Setup screen,
      which should look like this (the specific values on your screen may differ)
    </p>
    <figure>
      <caption>Calculator Table Setup Screen</caption>
      <image source="AlgebraicSubstitutionImages\CalculatorTableEx6.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      For our table,
      the exercise amounts we are inputting start with 0 and go up in increments of 30 minutes.
      So, set the value for
      <q>TblStart</q>
      to 0, and
      <q><m>\Delta</m>Tbl</q>
      to 30.
      The
      <q><m>\Delta</m></q>
      is the Greek letter delta,
      which is commonly used in math and science to represent
      <q>change</q>
      or
      <q>change in</q>. So we are telling the calculator to start the table at 0 minutes and then change that input value in increments of 30 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, set
      <q>Independent</q>
      to Auto.
      Independent variable is just another term for input variable;
      in this case we are telling the calculator to plug in values of that variable automatically based on our instructions.
      If you instead set this to
      <q>Ask</q>
      you will need to type in the input values you want to use manually.
      Dependent variable is another word for output variable,
      which we also want the calculator to find automatically,
      so we set that to Auto as well.
      The result should look like this:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <caption>Calculator Table Setup Screen</caption>
      <image source="" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      Now we are ready to see our table.
      In the upper right hand corned there is a key labeled
      <q>GRAPH</q>
      and above it the marking
      <q>TABLE</q>. Hit
      <q>2nd</q>
      and then that key, and you should see this result:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <caption>Calculator Automatically Generated Table</caption>
      <image source="" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      Note that even though we only wanted to go as far as 120 minutes,
      the calculator keeps going.
      We never told it where to stop, and we never actually do.
      If you don't care about the values past 120 minutes, just ignore them.
      (Likewise, if you want the calculator to go farther,
      you can continue the table in either direction by scrolling using the up and down arrow keys.)
      And so, now we are ready to put it all together and make that presentation to our phys ed class:
    </p>

      <row bottom="minor">
        <cell />

        <p>
          Using the formula <m>C=\frac{5}{9}(F-32)</m> given in <xref ref="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample4">Example</xref>,
          create a table on your calculator which shows the Celsius equivalent for temperatures of <m>0^\circ \text{F}</m>,
          <m>32^\circ \text{F}</m>, <m>68^\circ \text{F}</m>,
          <m>98.6^\circ \text{F}</m>, and <m>212^\circ \text{F}</m>.
        </p>
      
    <p>
      First we enter the formula, replacing the input variable,
      using Y1 in place of C and X in pace of F. We will put parentheses around the fraction 5/9 to make it clear that the (X-32) is not part of the denominator.
      (This is actually not needed in this case,
      since order of operations would evaluate it with only the 9 in the denominator,
      but it is still clearer with the extra parentheses.)
    </p>

      <caption>Calculator Formula Entered on Formula Screen</caption>
      <image source="" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      Now, since there is no set increment between the input values we want to use,
      we will set the Independent variable to Ask. (It does not matter what your TblStart and <m>\Delta</m>Tbl are set to;
      the calculator will ignore them.):

    <p>
      Now, we got to the table, and enter the input values we want.
      (If your calculator already has some X values in place you can just type over them.)
      The result should look like this:

    <title>Tables with Multiple Inputs</title>
    <p>
      The examples we've done here with tables both involved formulas where there was just one input variable.
      Could we create a table for a formula where we needed to input more than one value,
      such as the <m>W=\frac{1}{2}cv^2</m> we used in <xref ref="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample4">Examples</xref>
      and <xref ref="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample5" />?
    </p>
    <p>
      The TI-83 and 84 calculators can do this,
      but they are really set up mainly for tables where there will only be one input value.
      In our work in this course, that will be fine.
      As we will see shortly,
      most of our attention in this course will be devoted to problems where there is just one input variable and one output variable.
      So we don't need to concern ourselves at the moment with calculator tables for multiple inputs.
      Any time we need to substitute in multiple values,
      we will do this by substituting and evaluating,
      as we did in <xref ref="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample4">Examples</xref>
      and <xref ref="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample5" />.

            A flooring store wants to promote a sale in which they will install any amount of carpeting for just <m>$75</m>
            (plus the cost of the carpeting).
            During this sale,
            for their most popular carpet style the cost to carpet <m>x</m> square feet can be found using the formula <m>y=3.98x+75</m>.
            The store manager wants to create a table which will show the total cost to carpet 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1500 and 1800 square feet.
            Create this table for him.
