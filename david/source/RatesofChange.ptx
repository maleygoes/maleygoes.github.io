  <title>Rates of Change</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus is best known for saying
      <q>the only constant is change</q>. This is a quote that gets used a lot,
      mainly because it applies to so many situations.
      There aren't many things in this world that aren't in some way changing,
      and so change is an important consideration in the mathematical models we use to describe this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the functions we've looked at so far,
      it's almost always been true that when you change the input value,
      the output value also changes.
      This is not a requirement for a function;
      a constant function like <m>f(x)=42</m>
      (which always give the exact same output no matter what you input)
      is a perfectly good function.
      But constant functions aren't really all that useful or interesting.
      Change is everywhere in the world,
      and so the functions we are likely to find useful to mathematically model the world will naturally be functions which reflect those changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we'll discuss rates of change in mathematical models.

    <title>Average Rates of Change</title>
    <p>
      Suppose you are driving down the highway in a car.
      We can look at the distance you've travelled as a function of the time you've been driving.
      Let's also suppose we know the following:
    </p>

        <cell>1</cell>
        <cell>58</cell>
      </row>
      <row bottom="minor">
        <cell />
        <cell />
      </row>
    </tabular>
    <p>
      It's no surprise that the distance you've traveled has changed as time goes by;
      that's kind of the point of driving down the highway in a car!
      You're moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know from experience that
      <q>moving</q>
      can happen at different rates.
      Sometimes you move fast, sometimes you move slow.
      How fast were you moving in the first hour of your trip?
      Well, common sense says that you traveled 58 miles in one hour,
      so that means that your speed was 58 miles per hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, common sense also tells us that this 58 miles per hour is not the exact speed you were traveling at every single moment of that hour.
      When you're driving,
      of course you sometimes are going faster and sometimes going slower.
      You may have sped up to pass or going down hill,
      and may have slowed down in a construction zone, going up hill,
      or when you noticed that police car with a radar gun pointed at you.
      Even if you had the cruise control set at 58 for the entire hour,
      there would still be some variation in your speed
      (since cruise control does not maintain a perfectly constant speed).
      So, when we say you were going 58 miles per hour,
      we understand that this is an average speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a little more formal about this, we could write:
      <me>
        average \text{ }  speed = \frac{distance \text{ }  traveled}{time \text{ }  elapsed} = \frac{58 \text{ }  miles}{1 \text{ }  hour} = 58 \text{ }  miles \text{ }  per \text{ }  hour
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, this was an average speed we could calculate in our heads just using common sense.
      If we weren't looking at just the first hour or the trip we might not be able to do the calculation quite so simply,
      but we can adapt.
      Suppose we want to calculate an average speed based on this portion of your trip:
    </p>
    <tabular>
      <row bottom="minor">
        <cell />
        <cell />
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Time (Hours)</cell>
        <cell>Distance Traveled (miles)</cell>
      </row>
      <row bottom="minor">
        <cell />
        <cell />
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>1</cell>
        <cell>58</cell>
      </row>
      <row bottom="minor">
        <cell />
        <cell />
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>2.5</cell>
        <cell>149.5</cell>
      </row>
      <row bottom="minor">
        <cell />
        <cell />
      </row>
    </tabular>
    <p>
      The distance traveled over this portion of the trip can be calculated by subtracting <m>149.5 - 58 = 91.5</m> miles.
      The time elapsed could also be found by subtraction - - this portion of the trip took <m>2.5 - 1 = 1.5</m> hours.
      Then:
      <me>
        average \text{ }  speed = \frac{distance \text{ }  traveled}{time \text{ }  elapsed} = \frac{91.5 \text{ }  miles}{1.5 \text{ }  hours} = 61 \text{ }  miles \text{ }  per \text{ }  hour
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the average speed for this portion of the trip was 61 miles per hour.
      Not surprisingly,
      this is a different average speed that what we calculated for the first hour.
      It stands to reason that since your speed varies,
      your average speed also will vary depending on what portion of your trip we are looking at.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that in both cases, we essentially did the same thing.
      To find the average speed
      (that is, the average rate of change in the distance traveled as a function of time),
      we found the distance traveled
      (the change in the output)
      by subtracting and divided it by the time elapsed
      (the change in the input)
      which we also found by subtracting.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can generalize this as follows:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
              <idx><h>Average Rate of Change</h></idx> <em><em>The Average Rate of Change (
          <q>AROC</q>
          ) Formula</em></em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The average rate of change of <m>f(x)</m> between <m>x=a</m> and <m>x=b</m> is
          <me>
            AROC=\frac{\Delta output}{\Delta input}=\frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x}=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          (The symbol <m>\Delta</m> means
          <q>the change in</q>.)
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This formula just generalizes the speed example we were discussing above
      (where the output was distance and input was time.)
      But it applies to lots of other things other than speed - it can be used to find the average rate of change for any function at all.

        <p>
          Following the formula,
          using the temperatures at midnight (i.e. at time = 0) and 6 a.m. (i.e. at time = 6):
          <me>
            AROC = \frac{\Delta temperature}{\Delta time} = \frac{f(6)-f(0)}{6-0} = \frac{39-48}{6-0} = -1.5
          </me>
          So, between midnight and 6 a.m. the temperature was changing at an average rate of <m>-1.5 \deg F</m> per hour.
          Equivalently,
          we could say it was dropping at average rate of <m>1.5 \deg F</m> per hour (saying
          <q>dropping</q>
          indicates direction and so eliminates the need for the negative sign.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Following the same approach:
          <me>
            AROC = \frac{\Delta temperature}{\Delta time} = \frac{f(10)-f(6)}{10-6} = \frac{48-39}{10-6} = 2.25
          </me>
          So, between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. the temperature was increasing at an average rate of <m>2.25 \deg F</m> per hour.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Again:
          <me>
            AROC = \frac{\Delta temperature}{\Delta time} = \frac{f(10)-f(0)}{10-0} = \frac{48-48}{10-0} = 0
          </me>
          So between midnight and 10 a.m. the average rate of change of the temperature was <m>0 \deg F</m> per hour.
          Note that this does not mean that the temperature was not changing!
          This average rate of change means that when you average out all the changes the overall increases and decreases balance each other out.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The notion of average rate of change can be applied to any function,
      regardless of whether or not we have any particular mathematical model in mind.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="RateofChangeExample2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the average rate of change in
          <m>f(x)=x^2-3x+7</m> between <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=1</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      To find the average rate of change we need both inputs and outputs.
      We are given the two inputs,
      but we need to use the function formula to find the corresponding outputs.
      <me>
        f(-1)=(-1)^2-3(-1)+7=11\\ f(1)=(1)^2-3(1)+7=5
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Using these in the AROC formula we get:
      <me>
        AROC=\frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(1)-f(-1)}{1-(-1)} = \frac{5-11}{1-(-1)} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      So the average rate of change of this function between <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=1</m> is <m>-3</m>. }

    <title>Interpreting Average Rates of Change</title>
    <p>
      When we are talking about a car traveling down the highway,
      it's not much of a stretch to realize that the rate of change we are talking about is a speed,
      and if the distance is in miles and time is in hours,
      it's fairly obvious that this speed would be measured in miles per hour.
      Likewise, if temperature is in <m>\deg F</m> and time is in hours,
      it's not hard to see that this functions average rate of change would be measure in <m>\deg F</m> per hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But sometimes we are looking at models where common sense isn't so reliable a guide,
      either because the model could be set up to work in more than one way and we're not <m>100\%</m> sure about how it actually is set up,
      or because what we are modeling is unfamiliar.
      How do we interpret and put units on average rates of change then?
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, there is always a clear pattern to the units,
      which can help with interpretation.
      When we calculated that first speed, we took
      <me>
        \frac{58 \text{ }  miles}{1 \text{ }  hour}
      </me>
      and got an average speed of 58 miles per hour.
      Now, our attention was mainly focused on the numbers.
      That 58 came from dividing
      <m>\frac{58}{1}</m>, but now notice the units.
      We are dividing <m>\frac{miles}{hour}</m> and the units we end up with were miles per hour,
      which can also be written as
      <q>miles/hour</q>. The fact that this looks like just another way of writing the fraction is not a coincidence.
      Units for average rates of change always work out this way!
    </p>
    <p>
      When we found the average rate of temperature change between midnight and 6 a.m. we ended up with
      <m>\frac{-9}{6}</m> to get the number <m>-1.5</m>, but the units
      <q><m>\deg F</m> per hour</q>
      came from the fact that the numerator was a change of temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and the denominator was a change of time in hours.
      It was this <m>\frac{\deg F}{hour}</m> that made the average rate of change be measured in
      <q><m>\deg F</m>/hour</q>
      or
      <q><m>\deg F</m> per hour</q>.

          What is the average rate of change in this function between the two points given in this table (rounded to one decimal place)?
          What are the units?
          What does this average rate of change tell you in practical terms?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      We are treating distance as a function of gasoline,
      so distance is the output and gasoline is the input.
      So, using the AROC formula we get:
      <me>
        AROC = \frac{\Delta output}{\Delta input} = \frac{\Delta distance}{\Delta gasoline} = \frac{255.8-108.6}{7.5-3.2} = \frac{147.2}{4.3} = 34.2
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The units are always
      <q>output units per input unit</q>
      so this means the average rate of change is actually
      <q>34.2 miles per gallon</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The average rate of change tells us the rate at which distance is changing as the amount of gas used changes.
      In other words, how far you go versus how much gas you burn.
      It might not be easy to see what the practical meaning is based just on that description though.
      The units give us a clue though.
      Just saying
      <q>34.2 miles per gallon</q>
      gives a huge hint that we are talking about my average gas mileage for this portion of the trip. }
    </p>
    <p>
      As in this example,
      the units of the average rate of change often give us a big hint about what the average rate of change actually means.

          Mobile phones contain small amounts of valuable metals,
          and increasingly phones are being recycled to reclaim these materials.
          Suppose that the amount of silver
          (in kilograms)
          that a recycler expects can be recovered is a function of the phones' weight
          (in tons).

        <p>
          The recycler expects to recover 16.1 kilograms of silver from 5 tons of used phones and 32.7 kilograms from 10 tons.
          Find the average rate of change of this function
          (rounded to one decimal place)
          including the appropriate units.
          What does this average rate of change tell you in a practical sense?

      </me>
      the units are
      <q>output units per input unit</q>, so using this and rounding we conclude that the average rate of change is
      <q>3.3 kilograms of silver per ton of recycled phones</q>.

    <p>
      To interpret this,
      we know that the amount of expected silver to be recovered changes relative to the amount of phones,
      so this rate should tell us on average how quickly we expect the amount of recovered silver to be changing as more phones are processed.
      More helpfully,
      the units give us a huge hint: The recycler expects, on average,
      that they will recover 3.3 kilograms of silver per ton of recycled phones. }

    <title>Constant vs. Nonconstant Rates of Change</title>
    <p>
      As we've emphasized already,
      what we are after here is the average rate of change for functions.
      We need to always be clear that what we have is only an average.
      If your average speed over the first hour of a trip is 58 miles per hour,
      we all understand that this gives an indication of how fast you were driving over the course of that hour overall,
      but we all also understand that this does not mean that you were driving 58 miles per hour the whole time,
      or even at any specific time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's possible that your speed stayed pretty close to 58 mph the whole time,
      but it's also possible that you drove 95 mph for part of the hour and were not moving at all during other parts of the hour
      (presumably when you got pulled over for doing 95.)
      Either way, you could have ended up with a 58 mph average speed.
      Likewise, it's possible that,
      say, 17 minutes into the trip you were going 58,
      but it's not at all unlikely that at that specific time you were going faster or slower.
      All we know is the average.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, knowing that the average rate of change in temperature was
      <m>0 \deg F</m> per hour from midnight till 10 a.m. tells us something valuable about the overall change in temperature,
      but it tells us nothing about whether the temperature stayed fairly stable or bounced around a lot,
      and it tells us nothing about the temperature at 3 a.m. or 7 a.m. or any other particular time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It makes sense that our mathematical models can't give us this information.
      Finding an average speed or rate of temperature change only requires us to know where things stood at the start and at the end of period we're looking at.
      We don't need to know about how things varied along the way.
      To know what was going on at some point in between requires us to have a lot more information.
      Can you imagine how complicated it would be to create a mathematical model to precisely match up with everything that happens along the course of an hour's driving?
    </p>
    <p>
      In some special cases, though, we can know more.
      If the rate of change is itself not changing
      (that is, if the rate of change is constant)
      then we know what the rate of change was at any given time - it's always the same.
      This is a very special situation that certainly can't be relied on to happen with things like driving or temperatures,
      but when it does occur, it certainly is a nice trait to have.
      We'll close this chapter by noting this and offering an example where this happens.
      We'll have a lot more to say about functions with constant rates of change in the following chapter!
    </p>
    <example xml:id="RateofChangeExample5">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The amount of a residential electric bill
          (in dollars)
          is a function of the electricity used
          (in kilowatt hours).
          The function is given by the formula <m>A(x)=12.75+0.12x</m>.
          If my electric usage changes from 720 to 860 kilowatt hours,
          what will the average rate of change of my electric bill be as that usage increases?
          What if it then decreases from 860 kilowatt hours to 585 kilowatt hours?
          Does it seem likely that the rate of change will always be the same?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      To determine the change in usage from <m>x=720</m> to <m>x=860</m> kilowatt hours,
      we need to know the amount of the bills for those usage levels.
      <me>
        A(720) = 12.75+0.12(720) = 99.15\\ A(860) = 12.75+0.12(860) = 115.95
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      So the average rate of change is
      <md>
        <mrow>AROC \amp = \frac{\Delta bill}{\Delta usage} = \frac{\Delta A(x)}{\Delta x}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{A(860)-A(720)}{860-720}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{115.95-99.15}{860-720}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\frac{16.80}{140}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =0.12</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      So we would conclude that as usage changes from 720 to 860 kilowatt hours,
      the bill changes at an average rate of <m>$0.12</m> per kilowatt hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculating the bill for 585 kilowatt hours we get:
      <me>
        A(585)=12.75+0.12(585)=82.95
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      And then:
      <md>
        <mrow>AROC \amp = \frac{\Delta bill}{\Delta usage} = \frac{\Delta A(x)}{\Delta x}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{A(585)-A(860)}{585-860}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{82.95-115.95}{585-860}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\frac{-33}{-260}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =0.12</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      So as the usage goes from 860 to 585 kilowatt hours the average rate of change is again <m>$0.12</m> per kilowatt hour. }
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that these two average rates of change are the same could be a coincidence,
      but there is reason to think something more might be going on here.
      The rate of change is giving us a rate per kilowatt hour,
      and it seems reasonable to suppose that the electric bill might be based on some set price per kilowatt hour.
      (Of course, it might not be, too,
      since there might be a discount or a surcharge for higher or lower usage amounts.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding to this suspicion, though,
      is the fact that the average rate of change <m>0.12</m> appears in the function formula.
      In fact, if you think through how you would go about calculating an electric bill if there were a set price per kilowatt hour,
      the given formula seems to match up with that pretty nicely.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we are not yet able to say for certain that this average rate of change is in fact a constant rate of change,
      there seems to be good reason to think it might be.

            yes, because the cruise control is set.
            (in reality cruise control doesn't keep the speed at a constant,
            so the average rate of change will not always be exactly the same,
            but it is reasonable to treat it as constant since it maintains
            <q>pretty much</q>
            the same speed.
            So in reality the answer is no,

                  Both these average costs you calculated here and the average rates of change you calculated in #21 can be thought of as the cost per guest invited.
                  Yet the amounts are different.
                  Explain the difference in practical terms between the cost-per-guest values you calculated in #21 and the cost-per-guest you calculated here.
