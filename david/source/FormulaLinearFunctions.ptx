  <title>Finding Formulas for Linear Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Of course not every function is linear,
      but lots and lots of useful functions are.
      We've already seen some of the properties of linear functions,
      specifically how to find their slopes and intercepts,
      and what those slopes and intercepts tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      In almost all of our work so far, though,
      we've assumed that we already had a formula for a given linear function,
      and then could work from that formula.
      In this section,
      we'll fully explore something we've hinted at in a few examples but not yet developed:
      how to find the formula for a function that we've determined to be linear.
      As you'll see,
      the properties of linear functions that we've already observed are not just helpful in interpreting functions whose formulas we somehow already know â€“ they are incredibly useful in helping us find formulas for those functions in the first place!
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Formulas for Linear Functions Given Slope and Intercept</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="LinearFunctionsandIntercepts">Chapter</xref>,
      we introduced the slope-intercept form for a linear function,
      <m>f(x)=mx+b</m>.
      We noted that a function is linear if and only if it can be written in this form.
      So, if we know the slope and vertical intercept of a linear function,
      we can write a formula for the function simply by plugging that slope and intercept into this general form.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FormulaLinearFunctionsExample1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>f(x)</m> is a linear function whose slope is <m>-5</m> and vertical intercept is <m>(0, 8)</m>.
          Find a formula for <m>f(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Since it is linear, we know that
      <m>f(x)=mx+b</m> for the appropriate values of <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>.
      Now <m>m</m> is the slope, so we know that <m>m</m> is <m>-5</m>.
      The vertical intercept can be given as a point, as it is here,
      or just as the output value of that point which would be just <m>8</m>,
      and so that's <m>b</m>.
      So substituting thosevalues into the slope-intercept form we get that
      <me>
        f(x)=-5x+8
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      It really is just that simple,
      if we know the slope and vertical intercept.
      Of course, we won't always have those values at our disposal,
      but since they are pretty significant features,
      it's actually not all that unusual to have them available to find a linear function's formula.
      In fact, when we worked out a couple formulas at the start of <xref ref="LinearFunctionsandIntercepts">Section</xref> using common sense reasoning,
      this is in fact what we were doing.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FormulaLinearFunctionsExample2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A new bottle of vitamins contains <m>75</m> pills,
          and a full day's dose is <m>3</m> pills.
          Find a formula for the number of pills the bottle will contain after <m>t</m> full daily doses have been taken.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The function is linear,
      because with each full daily dose the number of pills changes by the same amount,
      it drops by three.
      The vertical intercept is the starting point, or more precisely,
      it is the number of pills in the bottle when the number of daily doses taken is zero.
      So <m>m</m> is <m>-3</m> and <m>b</m> is <m>75</m>.
      And so:
      <me>
        f(t)=-3t+75
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      It's not unusual to change the formula a bit,
      especially when a different order might seem to better reflect the
      <q>story</q>
      the function is describing.
      Here, we start with <m>75</m> pills and then take away <m>3</m> each day,
      so it might seem more natural to write this as <m>f(t)=75-3t</m>.
      Of course, this is algebraically equivalent to the formula we wrote above,
      so this alternative is also a correct formula for the function.
      At least for now, we will try to stick with the <m>mx+b</m> order,
      to emphasize that this is what we are using,
      but it is not at all incorrect to write this function either way.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Formulas for Linear Models Given Slope and Input-Output Pair</title>
    <p>
      Of course, we aren't always lucky enough to have both the slope and the vertical intercept.
      If we have the slope and one input-output pair for a linear function,
      we can still find the function's formula,
      albeit with a little more effort required.
      We will present two different methods for doing this by way of a specific example.
      Either method will always work,
      and so which one you use is a matter of preference.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <em><em>Method #1: Back Substitution</em></em>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Start with the general form
                <m>f(x)=mx+b</m> (replacing the <m>x</m> and <m>f(x)</m> with the actual names of the function and input variable if they are different)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Plug in the known value of the slope as <m>m</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Using the known input-output pair,
                plug in the input for <m>x</m> and the output for <m>f(x)</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Solve the resulting equation for <m>b</m> to get the vertical intercept.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                You now have the slope and vertical intercept; use these in the
                <q><m>f(x)=mx+b</m></q>
                form to get the function formula.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We can see how this works with the following two examples.
      We will actually start with a
      <q>numbers only</q>
      example just to show how this method works,
      and then will move to a real-world application example which will allow us to see both how the method works and a little bit of interpretation along the way.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FormulaLinearFunctionsExample3">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the formula for the linear function <m>g(t)</m> given that the function's slope is <m>-4.5</m> and the function's graph passes through the point <m>(5, 12)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          We begin with the fact that since we know <m>g(t)</m> is linear,
          it must have a formula of the form:
          <me>
            g(t)=mx+b
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now since we know the slope, we can plug that in to get:
          <me>
            g(t)=-4.5t+b
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Next, since the graph passes through the point <m>(5,12)</m> we know that <m>g(5)=12</m>,
          and so if we plug in the input of <m>5</m> for <m>t</m> the output must be <m>12</m>.
          Plugging those values in we get:
          <me>
            12=-4.5(5)+b
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now this is an equation we can solve for <m>b</m>.
          Doing that we get:
          <me>
            12 = -22.5 + b
          </me>
          <me>
            b=34.5
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          So now we know that our function's slope is <m>-4.5</m> and its vertical intercept is <m>34.5</m>.
          So, putting these facts together,
          we conclude that the formula is:
          <me>
            g(t)=-4.5t+34.5
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In this first example we listed the numbered steps of the method explicitly.
      We won't do that in future examples,
      but you can see that we are in fact still following them.
      In the next example,
      we'll use the method to find a formula where there is a real world interpretation to the linear function and see how this gives some extra insight into why this method works.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FormulaLinearFunctionsExample4">
      <statement>
        <p>
          An online music site charges a fixed monthly membership fee,
          which allows unlimited streaming.
          Members can also download songs for <m>$0.85</m> each.
          Last month I downloaded <m>32</m> songs and paid <m>$35.20</m>.
          Find a formula for the amount I pay as a function of the number of songs I download.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      First we note that this function would indeed be linear.
      The input is music purchased
      (counted in songs),
      and the output is cost
      (in dollars).
      The rate of change would be dollars per song,
      and we are told this is a constant <m>$0.85</m> per song.
      So the function is linear.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we let <m>s</m> be the number of songs and <m>C(s)</m> be the cost for downloading that many songs, then:
      <me>
        C(s)=mx+b
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Plugging in the known slope we get:
      <me>
        C(s)=0.85s+b
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since an input of <m>32</m> songs gives and output of a <m>$35.20</m> charge, we know:
      <me>
        35.2 = 0.85(32)+b
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      And so we solve for <m>b</m> and get:
      <me>
        35.2 = 27.2+b
      </me>
      <me>
        b=8
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting the slope and vertical intercept together we get that the overall formula must be:
      <me>
        C(s)=0.85s+8
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can add some interpretation to this formula as well.
      The vertical intercept is the charge you'd pay when the input - the number of songs you download - is zero.
      So, we can interpret this function as telling us that you pay
      <m>$8</m> per month just to have the service,
      plus <m>$0.85</m> per download. }
    </p>
    <p>
      This example agrees with a less-structured but commonsense way of figuring this out.
      Rather than using the formal method we've laid out here,
      you could have figured this formula out by reasoning that since each download costs
      <m>$0.85</m>, I must have paid <m>32($0.85)=$27.20</m> for the downloads.
      Since my total charge was <m>$35.20</m>,
      the membership fee must have been <m>$35.20-$27.20 = $8</m>.
      From this you could have easily arrived at the formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such reasoning is perfectly correct,
      and in fact if you look through the example,
      it's actually pretty much what we did!
      There's nothing wrong with taking this less-structured approach,
      but in cases where the interpretation is not so easy to see it may not work so well.
      The structured method we've laid out here always works,
      whether the interpretation is easy,
      difficult, or even if there is no interpretation at all
      (as in <xref ref="FormulaLinearFunctionsExample3">Example</xref>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now at the start of this section we promised a second method,
      and we will introduce that now,
      and then illustrate its use with the same two examples we've just worked out with the first method.
      Again, it must be emphasized that both methods will always work,
      but for a number of reasons,
      your instructor may prefer, or even insist that you use one or the other.
      Make sure that you are clear about the expectations in the course that you are taking.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Point-Slope Form</title>
    <p>
      This second method is a formula,
      derived from the formula for slope.
      Before presenting the formula,
      we'll briefly show where it comes from.
      Though you need not fear being asked to reproduce the derivation yourself,
      it's good to see at least once that our formulas really do come from somewhere!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our formula for slope <idx><h>Linear Function</h><h>Slope</h></idx> can be written in the form:
      <me>
        m=\frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x} = \frac{\Delta output}{\Delta input}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, suppose we have a particular input-output pair for a linear function.
      If we call this particular input value <m>x_0</m> then we would call the output value <m>f(x_0)</m> or using an output variable we could call it just <m>y_0</m>.
      To keep the notation a little simpler,
      we will use <m>y_0</m> instead of the function notation here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's let just plain <m>x</m> and just plain <m>y</m> be any other input and output for this function. (To be clear:
      <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> is the specific input-output pair that we know,
      and just plain <m>(x,y)</m> represents any other input-output pair for the function - not any specific input-output pair that we know.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>\Delta output</m> and <m>\Delta input</m> can be found by subtracting outputs and inputs,
      and so going back to the slope formula we'd get:
      <me>
        m=\frac{y-y_0}{x-x_0}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Which we can then solve for <m>y</m> by first clearing the fraction and then simplifying:
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{y-y_0}{x-x_0}\amp =m</mrow>
        <mrow>\left( \frac{y-y_0}{x-x_0} \right)(x-x_0) \amp = m(x-x_0)</mrow>
        <mrow>y-y_0\amp =m(x-x_0)</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp =m(x-x_0)+y_0</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This work has led us to the point-slope form for the equation of a linear function.
      Plugging in the slope and known input-output pair directly into this form gives an equation for the linear function;
      it can then be readily simplified into slope-intercept form.
    </p>
    <definition>

        <p>
              <idx><h>Linear Function</h><h>Point-Slope Form</h></idx>
        </p>
        <p>
          If <m>m</m> is the slope and
          <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> is a given input-output pair for a linear function,
          the function's formula can be found by plugging these values into the form:
          <me>
            y=m(x-x_0)+y_0
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          If the input variable is a letter other than <m>x</m> that letter would be used in place of <m>x</m> in this form;
          if there is an output variable given then that letter would likewise be used in place of <m>y</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can then be simplified into slope-intercept form if desired,
          and the <m>y</m> can be replaced with an <m>f(x)</m> to use function notation.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We will illustrate the use of this method by reworking the previous two examples.
    </p>

      <statement>

        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Here the input variable is <m>t</m> and so we use that in place of <m>x</m>.
      There is no output variable given so we will use <m>y</m>.

    <p>
      We have here that <m>m=-4.5</m>,
      <m>t_0=5</m> and <m>y_0=12</m>.
      We plug these into the point-slope form to get:
      <me>
        y=m(t-t_0)+y_0\\ y=-4.5(t-5)+12
      </me>
      and now we simplify:
      <me>
        y=-4.5t+22.5 + 12\\ y=-4.5t+34.5
      </me>
      and finally rewriting in function form by replacing the <m>y</m> with an <m>g(t)</m>:
      <me>

    <title>Formulas for Linear Models Given Two Input-Output Pairs</title>
    <p>
      Sometimes we are not even lucky enough to have the slope for a linear function.
      We can, however,
      still find the formula for a linear function if we have not just one but two input-output pairs for the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that if we know two input-output pairs for a function,
      we can use them to calculate its slope.
      Then, once we have the slope,
      we can use the methods we've already discussed in this chapter to find the formula for the function.
      If we have the slope and one input-output pair we are set - and in this case,
      we actually have more than one!

              <p>
                Use the slope together with either one of the input-output pairs to find the function's formula,

    <p>
      Essentially then we are just adding on an additional step at the start - finding the slope.
      Once we've done that, we are pretty much in the same boat as before.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="FormulaLinearFunctionsExample7">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the formula for the linear function whose graph passes through the points <m>(2,9)</m> and <m>(-1,24)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      We first find the slope:
      <md>
        <mrow>m\amp =\frac{\Delta output}{\Delta input}=\frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x}=\frac{f(2)=f(-1)}{2-(-1)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\frac{9-24}{2-(-1)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\frac{-15}{3}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =-5</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We now know the slope and can use it together with either of the two given input-output pairs.
      Here we will use <m>(2,9)</m> for no particular reason other than we have to pick one of them. (Using the other pair will work equally well).
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll use the Back Substitution Method here (though using the point-slope form would work equally well.
      You've got choices!)
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the function is linear we know it can be written in the form:
      <me>
        f(x)=mx+b
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Plugging in the slope we get:
      <me>
        f(x)=-5x+b
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      And now plugging in the input-output pair and solving for <m>b</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>9\amp =-5(2)+b</mrow>
        <mrow>9\amp =-10+b</mrow>
        <mrow>b=19</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally putting this all together we get:
      <me>
        f(x)=-5x+19
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing a second input-output pair gives an opportunity to check your answer if you like.
      If the formula is correct,
      we know it should give <m>f(-1)=24</m> because <m>(-1,24)</m> is on its graph.
      You can verify for yourself that this does indeed work correctly.

      <statement>
        <p>
          In patients with diabetes,
          blood sugar levels often fluctuate dramatically during the day and from day to day.
          Therefore, measuring a patient's blood sugar level at any given time does not really reveal very much about overall blood sugar control.
        </p>
        <p>
          A blood test known as
          <q>glycated hemoglobin</q>
          or
          <q>A1C</q>
          can be performed which measures a patients overall average blood sugar levels over the previous two to three months.
          It measures the percent of hemoglobin in the blood that has been affected by exposure to glucose.
          The average blood sugar level is a linear function of the A1C level.
          An A1C level of <m>7.0\%</m> corresponds to an average blood sugar of <m>154 mg/dl</m>
          (milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood).
          An A1C level of <m>10.0\%</m> corresponds to an average blood sugar level of <m>241 mg/dl</m>. (Source: Wikipedia,
          <q>glycated hemoglobin</q>, accessed 7/24/11)

      <li>
        <p>
          Here we know two input-output pairs,
          and so we can use them to find the slope:
          <md>
            <mrow>m\amp =\frac{\Delta output}{\Delta input}=\frac{\Delta average \text{ }  blood \text{ }  sugar}{\Delta A1C}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\frac{241-154}{10-7}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\frac{87}{3}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =29</mrow>
          </md>
          Now we can use either input-output pair together with this slope to find the vertical intercept and complete the formula.
          Using <m>x</m> and <m>f(x)</m> for the input variable and function name we get:
          <me>
            f(x)=mx+b
          </me>
          For no reason other than we've got to pick one,
          we'll use the pair <m>(10,241)</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>241\amp =29(10)+b</mrow>
            <mrow>241\amp =290+b</mrow>
            <mrow>b\amp =-49</mrow>
          </md>
          Putting this together we get the formula:
          <me>
            f(x)=-29x-49
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now that we have the formula we can use it.
          Plugging in <m>x=8.2</m> we get:
          <md>
            <mrow>f(x)\amp =29x-49</mrow>
            <mrow>f(8.2)\amp =29(8.2)-49</mrow>
            <mrow>f(8.2)\amp =188.8</mrow>
          </md>
          So an A1C level of <m>8.2\%</m> indicates an average blood sugar level of <m>188.8 mg/dl</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Once again using the formula,
          but this time substituting in an output value:
          <md>
            <mrow>f(x)\amp =29x-49</mrow>
            <mrow>100\amp =29x-49</mrow>
            <mrow>151\amp =29x</mrow>
            <mrow>x=\frac{151}{29} \approx 5.21</mrow>
          </md>.
          So an average blood sugar of
          <m>100 mg/dl</m> equates to an A1C level of approximately <m>5.21\%</m>.

          Linear functions by definition must have a constant rate of change.
          What this means in a given application,
          though, can lead to some confusion.
          For example,
          suppose that a small ice cream company is trying to mathematically model its profits.
          The company has fixed costs
          (that is, costs that they have to pay regardless of how much ice cream they sell)
          of <m>$4,000</m> per month.
          They sell their ice cream for <m>$3.50</m> per pint,
          and it costs them <m>$2.25</m> to make each pint of ice cream.
          Ben says:
          <q>Well, our profit is clearly a linear function of the number of pints of ice cream we sell.
          Since <m>$3.50</m> -
          <m>$2.25</m> = <m>$1.25</m>,
          we make the same, steady <m>$1.25</m> per pint sold.
          Since our profits as a function of pints sold increase at a constant rate,
          the function is linear.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          Jerry says:
          <q>Nonsense!
          I agree that if our profit per pint sold were constant,
          the function would be linear, but it's not!
          If we sell, say, <m>5000</m> pints,
          we take in <m>5000($3.50) = $17,500</m>.
          It costs us <m>5000($2.25) = $11,250</m> to make that ice cream,
          plus our fixed costs are <m>$4,000</m>,
          for a total of <m>$15,250</m>.
          So we make <m>$17,500 - $15,250 = $2,250</m> profit.
          And that would be <m>$2,250/5000</m> pints = <m>$0.45</m> per pint.
          But now if we sell just <m>2000</m> pints,
          we take in <m>2000($3.50) = $7,000</m>.
          That ice cream costs <m>2000($2.25) = $4,500</m> to make,
          and so when you add in our fixed costs our costs are <m>$8,500</m> in total.
          So our ``make</q>
          <m>$7,000 - $8,500 = -$1,500</m>.
          So our
          <q>profit</q>
          is <m>-$1,500/2000 = -$0.75</m> per pint.
          A loss of <m>75</m> cents a pint sure ain't the same as a profit of <m>$0.45</m> per pint!''
