          Rachel is driving to visit her mother and her distance from home is a function of how many hours she has been driving.
          After <m>5</m> hours she is <m>325</m> miles from her house.
          After <m>10</m> hours she is <m>635</m> miles from her house.
          Find the average rate of change in her distance from home between <m>5</m> hours and <m>10</m> hours of her driving.
          Do you expect this rate to remain constant over the course of her entire trip?
